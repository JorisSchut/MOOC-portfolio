##Introduction
This readme file provides an overview of my progress in the Data Science Specialization on Coursera offered by the Jonhs Hopkins University Blooberg School of Public Health. In this document, I will provide an overview of my progress so far and my schedule to complete this specialization track.

##[The Data Science specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specialization/jhudatascience/1)
The Data Science specialization covers the concepts and tools you'll need throughout the entire data science pipeline, from asking the right kinds of questions to making inferences and publishing results. The Specialization concludes with a Capstone project that allows you to apply the skills you've learned throughout the courses.

###Courses in this specialization
 1. [The Data Scientist's Toolbox](https://www.coursera.org/course/datascitoolbox)
    Upon completion of this course you will be able to identify and classify data science problems. You will also have created your Github account, created your first repository, and pushed your first markdown file to your account.
 2. [R Programming](https://www.coursera.org/course/rprog)
    The course will cover an overview of R, R data types and objects, reading and writing data, control structures, functions, scoping rules, dates and times, loop functions, debugging tools, simulation, code profiling.
 3. [Getting and Cleaning Data](https://www.coursera.org/course/getdata)
    Upon completion of this course you will be able to obtain data from a variety of sources. You will know the principles of tidy data and data sharing. Finally, you will understand and be able to apply the basic tools for data cleaning and manipulation.
 4. [Exploratory Data Analysis](https://www.coursera.org/course/exdata)
    After successfully completing this course you will be able to make visual representations of data using the base, lattice, and ggplot2 plotting systems in R, apply basic principles of data graphics to create rich analytic graphics from different types of datasets, construct exploratory summaries of data in support of a specific question, and create visualizations of multidimensional data using exploratory multivariate statistical techniques.
 5. [Reproducible Research](https://www.coursera.org/course/repdata)
    In this course you will learn to write a document using R markdown, integrate live R code into a literate statistical program, compile R markdown documents using knitr and related tools, and organize a data analysis so that it is reproducible and accessible to others.
 6. [Statistical Inference](https://www.coursera.org/course/statinference)
    In this class students will learn the fundamentals of statistical inference. Students will receive a broad overview of the goals, assumptions and modes of performing statistical inference. Students will be able to perform inferential tasks in highly targeted settings and will be able to use  the skills developed as a roadmap for more complex inferential challenges.
 7. [Regression Models](https://www.coursera.org/course/regmods)
    In this course students will learn how to fit regression models, how to interpret coefficients, how to investigate residuals and variability.  Students will further learn special cases of regression models including use of dummy variables and multivariable adjustment. Extensions to generalized linear models, especially considering Poisson and logistic regression will be reviewed.
 8. [Practical Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/course/predmachlearn)
    Upon completion of this course you will understand the components of a machine learning algorithm. You will also know how to apply multiple basic machine learning tools. You will also learn to apply these tools to build and evaluate predictors on real data.
 9. [Developing Data Products](https://www.coursera.org/course/getdata)
    Students will learn how communicate using statistics and statistical products. Emphasis will be paid to communicating uncertainty in statistical results. Students will learn how to create simple Shiny web applications and R packages for their data products.
 10. [Data Science Capstone](https://www.coursera.org/course/dsscapstone)
      The capstone project class will allow students to create a usable/public data product that can be used to show your skills to potential employers. Projects will be drawn from real-world problems and will be conducted with industry, government, and academic partners.  The capstone project, will be in collaboration with [Swiftkey](http://swiftkey.com/en/).
