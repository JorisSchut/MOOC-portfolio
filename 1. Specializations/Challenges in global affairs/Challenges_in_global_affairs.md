##Introduction
This readme file provides an overview of my progress in the Challenges in Global Affairs Specialization on Coursera offered by Leiden University and the University of Geneva. In this document, I will provide an overview of my progress so far.

##[Challenges in GLobal Affairs](https://www.coursera.org/specialization/globalaffairs/3/overview)
This course series brings together three key dimensions in global affairs: International Political Economy, Global Security and International Organization Management. These themes will guide the capstone project where students are challenged to apply elements from various perspectives in global affairs to a practical case of their own choice (suggestions will be provided). The Specialization concludes with a Capstone project that allows you to apply the skills you've learned throughout the courses.

###Courses in this specialization
 1. [The Changing Global Order](https://www.coursera.org/course/globalorder)
    This course deals with international relations, peace and security and brings together a number of experts from the field and academia to share their perspectives. The course will help you gain insight into conflict resolution and the role organizations such as the United Nations Security Council, the European Union, the African Union and NATO play in a changing world.
 2. [Configuring the World: A Critical Political Economy Approach](https://www.coursera.org/course/configuringworld)
    In today's world, politics and economics are inextricably interconnected, but what is the nature of this connectivity? What are the power relationships that shape the world economy today and create new challenges for international institutions facing globalization? What makes some countries wealthier than others? Do we face cultural diversity or fragmentation? Does the type of governance effect economic development and social change or is it the other way around? How do we measure it and how trustworthy is the data? These issues and many more will be examined in this course along with up-to-date sources and biting criticism.
 3. [International Organizations Management](https://www.coursera.org/course/interorg)
    This course provides an overview of the management challenges international organizations & NGOs are faced with. You will learn key theoretical frameworks and practical tools to excel in this environment.
 4. [Global Affairs Final Project](https://www.coursera.org/course/globalaffairsfinal)
    In this capstone project we would like you to apply your academic skills, go out in the field and do research. You will apply knowledge and skills acquired in the various MOOCs to make your own creative contributions to ongoing challenges in international relations in practice. Each student will choose a topic and write an article-length essay. This written argument engages with other evidence in the form of visual and/or written texts. Students will also learn by giving and receiving feedback on each others' essays.
