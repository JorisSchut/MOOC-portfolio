##[The Entreperneurship: Launching an Innovative Business specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specialization/entrepreneurship/26?utm_medium=listingPage)
Students generate an innovative new venture concept (or enhance their existing concepts). Courses in innovation and new venture financing set the foundation for building a comprehensive, customer-validated business model. In the capstone project, students create an investor pitch.

The Specialization concludes with a Capstone project that allows you to apply the skills you've learned throughout the courses.
