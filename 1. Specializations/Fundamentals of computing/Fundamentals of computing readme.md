##Introduction
This readme file provides an overview of my progress in the Fundamentals of Computing Specialization on Coursera offered by Rice University. In this document, I will provide an overview of my progress so far and my schedule to complete this specialization track.

##[The Fundamentals of Computing specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specialization/fundamentalscomputing2/37?utm_medium=listingPage)
This series introduces students to the basics of analyzing and solving computational problems. It will provide students with a solid foundation in the mathematical and programming techniques that support creating efficient and well-designed solutions for such problems. The Specialization concludes with a Capstone project that allows you to apply the skills you've learned throughout the courses.

###Courses in this specialization
 1. [An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python](https://www.coursera.org/course/interactivepython1)
    This two-part course is designed to be a fun introduction to the basics of programming in Python. Our main focus will be on building simple interactive games such as Pong, Blackjack and Asteroids.
 2. [Principles of Computing (Part 1)](https://www.coursera.org/course/principlescomputing1)
    This two-part course introduces the basic mathematical and programming principles that underlie much of Computer Science. Students will refine their programming skills as well as learn the basics of creating efficient solutions to common computational problems.
 3. [Principles of Computing (Part 2)](https://www.coursera.org/course/principlescomputing2)
    Same description as part 1.
 4. [Algorithmic Thinking (Part 1)](https://www.coursera.org/course/algorithmicthink1)
    Experienced Computer Scientists analyze and solve computational problems at a level of abstraction that is beyond that of any particular programming language. This two-part class is designed to train students in the mathematical concepts and process of "Algorithmic Thinking", allowing them to build simpler, more efficient solutions to computational problems.
 5. [Algorithmic Thinking (Part 2)](https://www.coursera.org/course/algorithmicthink2)
    Same description as part 1.
 6. [The Fundamentals of Computing Specialization Capstone Exam]()
    The capstone exam will cover material from each of the courses in the "Fundamental of Computing" specialization.
