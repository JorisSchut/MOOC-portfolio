##Introduction
This readme file provides an overview of my progress in the Foundations of Teaching and Learning Specialization on Coursera offered by the Commonwealth Educational Trust. In this document, I will provide an overview of my progress so far and my schedule to complete this specialization track.

##[Foundations of Teaching and Learning](https://www.coursera.org/specialization/foundationsteaching/4?utm_medium=listingPage)
Foundations of Teaching for Learning is a program of study primarily for people who are currently teaching, but have had little or no formal teacher education. It is an introductory program that considers the three domains of being a teacher: Professional Knowledge and Understanding; Professional Practice; and Professional Values, Relationships and Engagement. The Specialization concludes with a Capstone project that allows you to apply the skills you've learned throughout the courses.
